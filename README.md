## Introduction

#### **React mindee** is a very opinionated JavaScript library that will help you build interactive canvas for computer vision detection use cases.

There are many powerful JavaScript frameworks and tools that can help you make an interactive canvas. But almost all of them are _low-level_. Like [KONVA](https://konvajs.org/) is a 2d canvas framework. It is good, it is powerful. But you may need to write a lot of code.

This library was made for building frontend interfaces on top of **[Mindee](https://mindee.com/)** document parsing APIs and more generally on top of any computer vision detection APIs.
